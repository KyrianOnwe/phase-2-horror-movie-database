      <p>A horror movie is an experience of abject terror without the benefit of any lightness whatsoever.  A good horror movie does not 'resolve' its dramatic elements, as such, but instead decreases the tension from a solid 10 to 'just enough to let you sleep'...for now.  But the fear will never abate.  This app is ONLY for GOOD horror movies.  Add them, watch them and never forget how they made you feel and we won't forget what it was that made you feel it!</p>
